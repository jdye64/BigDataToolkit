# BigDataToolkit
Utilities and scripts that make living the Big Data lifestyle a little more manageable

# Scripts
run_command.sh - Runs a command on all of the nodes in a cluster. I use for configuring OS level settings before using Ambari for the actual Hadoop installation. Things like configuring NTPD, turn off Transparent Huge Pages, etc.
